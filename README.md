2. Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.

The motivation of this project is the current discussion about global warming. Currently we develope an app to improve the environmental behaivoir of people. It is important in order to change something to know the reasons for the climate change. One reason is the co2 pollution. To understand the co2 pollution one has to consider the emerge during the years. Furthermore the distribution of co2 emission in the world will give interesting insights about the activities of the individual countries. 



3. Related Work. Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualisations we discussed in class, etc.
4. Project Objectives and Goals. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualisation. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.
5. Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.
6. Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How would data processing be implemented?
7. Visualisation Design. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualisation design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualisation. Discuss the pros and cons of each design. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the 8. Five Design Sheet Methodology (fds.design).
9. Tasks. Describe in detail which data manipulations (sort, filter,..) and visual manipulations (zoom, selection,â€¦) you would want to implement and how these support the goals.
10. Must-Have Features. List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure. These should be related to your final design.
11. Optional Features. List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical. These should be related to your final design.
12. Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write your schedule in terms of weekly deadlines.
13. Implementation details. List what tools/frameworks you used to implement your interactive visualisation. List the difficulties you encountered. List which of the desired features are implemented and which are missing.
14. Work Breakdown Structure (e.g. matrix) with a statement which project member did which part of the structure to what extend.
